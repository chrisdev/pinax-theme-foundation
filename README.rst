=======================================
A Foundation Theme for Django Projects
=======================================

A Pinax theme based on `Zurb Foundation`_.
Foundation is a popular CSS framework that is light weight, but includes
all the basics such as; a responsive grid, forms, dialog, navigation tabs,
buttons, typography and so on.
You can read more about the ideas behind
Foundation and how to use  it for rapid prototyping in this `article`_.

What's New
===================================

This version supports Foundation 5
-----------------------------------
- We support the latest version of Foundation (5.2.1)
- Updated the documentation
- The project now supports the  ``--template`` argument for ``django-admin.py
  startproject`` command
- Removed more ``Pinax 0.9`` dependencies however, the project
  should still be compatible with the other apps in  the ``Pinax``
  eco-system such as `django-user-account`_


Getting Started
----------------
Start by creating a new virtualenv for your project and install Django 1.6.2 ::

    mkvirtualenv mysite
    pip install Django==1.6.2


To use create a project based on the zero_ project run ::

    django-admin.py startproject mysite --template=https://github.com/chrisdev/foundation-project-zero/zipball/master

This will create a new Django project in the mysite directory with:

 - An apps folder for your internal apps
 - initial data (for handling ``sites.Site`` model)
 - Requirements files for use with pip_
 - A home for your site's static files
 - A set of templates designed to work with the foundation theme

Finally install the requirements, sync your database and
start the test server ::

    cd mysite
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py syncdb && python manage.py runserver

The account_ starter project provides all the features of the zero project in
addition to incorporating features to support `django-user-account`_.

`django-user-account`_ is an extremely useful ``Pinax`` app that
works in conjunction with django.contrib.auth to
take your Django project from having simple log in, log out and password reset
to a full blown account management system. To create a project based on the
account starter project ::

    django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/chrisdev/foundation-project-account/zipball/master mysite


.. _account: https://github.com/chrisdev/foundation-project-account/
.. _zero: https://github.com/chrisdev/foundation-project-zero/
.. _django-user-account: https://github.com/pinax/django-user-accounts/
.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/

Templates
------------
Your own templates should normally inherit from ``site_base.html``.
You should provide your own "footer" template ``_footer.html``.

Also change the Site name by editing ``fixture/initial_data.json``.
You can also use the Admin app for this purpose.

The **url** name "home" should be defined as the homepage.


Upgrading From Previous Versions
--------------------------------
To upgrade your site start by upgrading to the latest version
on pinax-theme-foundation ::

    pip install -- upgrade pinax-theme-foundation

The big change between Foundation 2 to 3 is the grid.
In Foundation 3 you no longer have to use *.container*
to define the grid. In Foundation 2 the grid was built around
``*.container > .row > .columns*``. In Foundation 3
you now just need to use ``*.row > .columns*``.
In Foundation 3 padding and borders no longer increase
the width of an element,
they only go inward so for example in Foundation 3 ``.three.columns``
always has a width of 25% with a 15px padding on the left and right.
You can find the Foundation 3 migration guide
`here <http://foundation.zurb.com/migration.php>`_
