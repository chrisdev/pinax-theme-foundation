Responsive Design Patterns
---------------------------
Responsive design implies that your site looks different on different devices (desktop,table,phone). 
Traditionally, you deal with this using the visibility classes to hiding content or collapsing the layout. 
Responsive design patterns allow you instead to plan how your sites are going to react on various display types and resolutions.
We have also included CSS to support
